His delivery is all wrong. I lived in the state for several years and I can still hear the strange patois that a Louisiana accent contains.

Mickey Rourke? whoever, he\\'ll have to be big).<br /><br />Overall, I thought the movie was only a 4 - the plot flopped around like a fish out of water and didn\\'t have the normal interesting, yet non-linear continuity that the book typically has.<br /><br />Hopefully, Hollywood will try another JLB book, \"Last Car to Elysican Fields\" would be a good choice.
